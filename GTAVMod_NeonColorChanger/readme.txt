Rainbow Neon
by libertylocked

This mod makes neon kit color on a vehicle dynamic. It creates a rainbow transition on the neon color!
To adjust transition speed, open RainbowNeon.cs and change the TICK_INTERVAL (which is in milliseconds).

Note: It is intentional that only the vehicle player is in will have rainbow neon effect.
