Simple Metric/Imperial Speedometer
by libertylocked

UPDATE 1.1: Now supports MPH, and more configurable parameters! 

A very simple and lite .NET script that shows your vehicle speed in km/h or mph. 

The filename is "Metric_Speedometer.dll", but it also supports MPH. 
Details on how to change the config can be seen in the INI file. 

Requirements: 
1. ScriptHookV

2. ScriptHookV DotNet

Installation: 
1. Put "Metric_Speedometer.dll" and "Metric_Speedometer.ini" in "scripts" folder. Create "scripts" folder if it does not exist. 
2. Open "Metric_Speedometer.ini" and change the configuration to your preference. 

FAQ: 
1. How do I change the unit to MPH? 
Set 'UseMph' to true in the INI. 
2. How do I make the background transparent? 
Set 'BackcolorA' to 0 in the INI. 
3. The speedometer doesn't show up in game! 
Check the INI file and make sure all the values are valid. Re-download the config file if necessary.
