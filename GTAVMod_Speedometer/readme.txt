Highly customizable!

2. ScriptHookV DotNet

INSTALLATION: 
1. Put "Metric_Speedometer.cs" and "Metric_Speedometer.ini" in "scripts" folder. Create "scripts" folder if it does not exist. 
2. Open "Metric_Speedometer.ini" and change the keybind for speedometer menu if F7 is already bound to other scripts. 
3. Run GTA V, press the key you've set in the INI to bring up the menu. Use NumPad 8 4 6 2 to navigate, NumPad 5 to confirm, NumPad 0 to go back.
4. (Optional) When you are done configuring, you can un-bind the key by setting "EnableMenu" to false in the INI file.

TROUBLESHOOTING: 
1. Make sure you have the latest ScriptHookV and ScriptHookVDotNet, and they are placed in game root directory. 
2. Make sure you have all the required redists for ScriptHookVDotNet installed (Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2013 (x64)) 
3. Check the INI config file and make sure all values are valid. Re-download the file if necessary. 
4. The speedometer still won't show up? Check the ScriptHookVDotNet.log in game root directory and paste me the related logs.
