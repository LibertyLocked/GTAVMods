Simple Metric/Imperial Speedometer
by libertylocked

A very simple and lite .NET script that shows your vehicle speed in km/h or mph. 

The filename is "Metric_Speedometer.dll", but it also supports MPH.
Details on how to change the config can be seen in the INI file.

This mod requires:
Script Hook V 
Script Hook V Dot Net 

How to install: 
1. Put "Metric_Speedometer.dll" and "Metric_Speedometer.ini" in "scripts" folder.
2. Open "Metric_Speedometer.ini" and change the configuration to your preference.
