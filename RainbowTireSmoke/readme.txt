Rainbow Tire Smoke
by libertylocked

This mod makes tire smoke on a vehicle dynamic. It creates a rainbow transition on the tire smoke color!
To adjust transition speed, open RainbowTireSmoke.cs and change the TICK_INTERVAL (which is in milliseconds).

Note: You must purchase a custom tire smoke color in order to activate rainbow transition!
